The report has been created and the information has been displayed in a clear and formal way. The report has three pages, namely High Level Metrics, Device Monitoring and Device Registration. The first page(High Level Metrics) contains the summary/overall information of the report which is the information of Devices, Zones and Categories. There are bar graphs, showing the count of device names found in different zones of the building and count of device names by categories. There is also a representaion tabular form which shows the device names, when were the devices installed and are the devices active or not. The second page(Device Monitoring) shows simialr work as of the information from the fisrt page but the only difference is that this page went deeper in showing the information of how devices are being monitored. The last page (Device Registration) then shows when and how many devices were registered. The user will be able to navigate from one page to another and understand the information clearly.
